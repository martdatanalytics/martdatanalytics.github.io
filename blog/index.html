		<p style="text-align:justify;"> Visualizing data is often one of the best ways to tease out patterns and interpret what you have collected.
		We adjust the choice of analysis software tools to suit the demands of our clients. If the client request his/her
		data to be analyzed using a specific software tool, we commit ourselves to learning the tool and provide the much 
		needed assistance. We have invested time in learning Python for data analysis and model simulations, SPSS for data
		coding, capturing and analysis, R Statistical Package, Matlab, OpenRefine and we are ready to unlock the key that
		is currently locking the potential endowed in your data. For more info, please send your inquiries in

<head> Levels of measurement</head>
<p>Determining the level of measurement of a set of data is commonly the first step in a statistical process. The four levels of measurement are nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio. These levels are hierarchical, ranging from nominal level, the lowest level of measurement, to ratio level, the highest level of measurement—and with higher levels subsuming the characteristics of lower levels. Thus, the characteristics associated with a certain level of measurement apply to data that achieve that level and to all data that achieve a level higher than that particular level. Following are the characteristics associated with each level: U Nominal level: When the highest level of a data set is nominal level, the data consist of categories (names, labels, colors, gender, geographic location, etc.) only. Standard mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) are not defined when applied to data that are strictly nominal-level data. U Ordinal level: When the highest level of a data set is ordinal level, the data consist of categories that can be arranged in some meaningful order according to their relative size or quality, but differences between data values are meaningless. For example, customer ratings of a service might be 1, 2, or 3, where 3 is “excellent” and 1 is “unacceptable.” Standard mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) are not defined when applied to data that reach only ordinal level. U Interval level: When the highest level of a data set is interval level, both ordering and computing differences can be meaningfully applied to the data. However, the zero point on a strictly interval level scale does not correspond to the absence of the quantity being measured, so ratios for data that reach only interval level are not considered meaningful. For instance, scores on subject content exams are interval-level data. A person who scores zero on a subject content exam does not necessarily have zero knowledge about the subject being tested by the exam. U Ratio level: When the highest level of a data set is ratio level, the data can be meaningfully ordered, both arithmetic differences and ratios are meaningful, and the scale has a meaningful zero. For instance, the weights of individuals are ratio-level data. A person who weighs 200 pounds is twice as heavy as a person who weighs 100 pounds, and zero pounds represents no weight.  </p>
